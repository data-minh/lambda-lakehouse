The Company was listed on the real estate investment trust market of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) on September 10, 2001 (Securities Code: 8952). Since its IPO, the size of the Company's assets (total acquisition price) has grown steadily, expanding from 92.8 billion yen to 1,167.7 billion yen as of March 31, 2025. Over the same period, the Company's portfolio has also increased from 20 properties to 77 properties. During the March 2025 period (October 1, 2024 to March 31, 2025), the Japanese economy continued to demonstrate a gradual recovery, despite some lingering stagnation in capital investment and personal consumption due to inflation and other factors. On the other hand, given the policy rate hikes by the Bank of Japan, the shift in global interest rates to a lowering phase, the impact of U.S. policy trends, such as trade policy and other factors, interest rate trends, overseas political and economic developments, and price trends, including resource prices, will continue to bear watching. In the office leasing market, demand continues to grow for leases driven by business expansion and relocations aimed at improving location. As a result, the vacancy rate in central Tokyo continues to decline gradually. In addition, rent levels are rising at an accelerating rate. In light of the prevailing conditions in the leasing market, the Company is striving to attract new tenants through strategic leasing activities and to further enhance the satisfaction level of existing tenants by adding value to its portfolio properties with the aim of maintaining and improving the occupancy rate and realizing sustainable income growth across the entire portfolio. In the real estate trading market, despite the Bank of Japan normalizing its monetary policy, the appetite for property acquisition among both domestic and foreign investors remains firm, backed mainly by the interest rate differential with overseas markets. There is still fierce competition, particularly for high-quality office buildings, and as a result, conditions for acquiring properties remain tough because expected yields are also low. In this market environment, the Company made sound investments based on its investment policy of aiming for sustainable growth in dividends to unitholders, which has remained unchanged since its listing on the TSE. Dividend per unit for the March 2025 period was 2,487 yen, up 18 yen from the September 2024 period.",,907787239424.0,JPY,JPX,127600.0,128300.0,yfinance,2025-10-24

Sekisui House Residential Investment Corporation (""SHI"", and collectively with SHR, the ""Two Investment Corporations"") was established on April 20, 2005 as an investment corporation investing primarily in residences and retail properties, with the corporate name of JOINT REIT Investment Corporation, and listed on the Real Estate Investment Trust Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange on July 28, 2005. In March 2010, a collaboration system was established with Sekisui House serving as the main sponsor and Spring Investment Co., Ltd. as joint sponsor for the investment corporation, which was renamed from JOINT REIT Investment Corporation to Sekisui House SI Investment Corporation in June 2010. Later, in June 2014, its Articles of Incorporation were revised to set residences as the sole target of investment, and the corporate name was changed to Sekisui House SI Residential Investment Corporation. Subsequently, in association with the shift to a structure in which Sekisui House serves as the sole sponsor in March 2017, SHI was renamed to Sekisui House Residential Investment Corporation in June 2017.

However, intending to secure strong returns and stability and growth of cash distributions through promoting a steady increase of assets under management and endeavor to maximize unitholder value by further expanding the scale of their assets and increasing their market presence and expanding a variety of opportunities for growth through utilizing the integrated corporate strength of the Sekisui House Group, the Two Investment Corporations conducted an absorption-type merger with SHR as the surviving corporation and SHI as the dissolving corporation (the ""Investment Corporation Merger""), setting May 1, 2018 as the effective date. SHR's investment policy is to conduct asset management that seeks to secure stable earnings over the medium to long term and steady growth of its investment assets, with residential properties and commercial properties as major investment targets. In addition to ""stable growth"" in Japan, SHR also decided that acquiring urban rental housing in the U.S. developed by Sekisui House would contribute to maximizing unitholder value by incorporating ""proactive growth"" from overseas (U.S.).
